This directory contains files necessary for using one of the word-based RSTM
backends as the STM in the <a href="http://stamp.stanford.edu/">STAMP benchmark
suite</a>. It has been tested to work with STAMP version 0.9.10.

Instructions:

1) Configure and compile RSTM.

   -- The object-based library backends RSTM and REDO-LOCK are not supported.
   -- The GCHeap allocator is not supported, configure with malloc.

2) Build the libstamp library.

   -- Make targets ee, el, and ll use different write acquisition/versioning
      algorithms where supported by your configured backend.
   -- See Makefile and rstm.cpp in $(RSTM)/libstamp for more information.

3) Download and unpack <a href="http://stamp.stanford.edu/">STAMP</a>.

4) Modify STAMP to point to your libstamp directory.

   -- $(STAMP)/common/Makefile.stm, change -ltl2 to -lrstm
   -- $(STAMP)/common/Defines.common.mk, change STM to the relative path to
      $(RSTM)/libstamp.
