This directory contains code for /swarm/, an OpenGL/GLUT application that uses
transactional memory during scene updating and rendering. More details can be
found in our ICPP, 2008 paper on inevitability.

BUILDING

  Configure and build the RSTM library, and then simply `make` in this
  directory. Running swarm with the -h option will provide a list of
  configurable parameters to the application. Refer to the web documenation for
  more information.
